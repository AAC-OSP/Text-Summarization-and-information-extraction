# Introduction
-	In the era of information overload, the "Text Summarization and Information Extraction Tool" is an innovative project designed to empower users with efficient and intelligent methods for processing textual content. This tool combines the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and web scraping to facilitate text summarization and information retrieval from both user-provided text and online sources, such as Wikipedia articles.
