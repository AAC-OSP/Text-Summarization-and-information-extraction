# Introduction
o	In the era of information overload, the "Text Summarization and Information Extraction Tool" is an innovative project designed to empower users with efficient and intelligent methods for processing textual content. This tool combines the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and web scraping to facilitate text summarization and information retrieval from both user-provided text and online sources, such as Wikipedia articles.

# Abstract
## Text Summarization
o	Utilizing spaCy's advanced NLP capabilities, the system employs extractive summarization techniques to condense lengthy textual content while preserving the essence and context.
## File Summarization
o	Extending beyond individual text documents, the project supports the summarization of entire files, be they in text or PDF formats. This feature aids in efficient management and comprehension of large datasets.
## Web Scraping
o	The system incorporates web scraping functionalities to fetch and process information from online sources. This ensures that the summarization process is not confined to pre-existing datasets but can dynamically adapt to the evolving landscape of the internet.
## Keyword Extraction
o	Employing spaCy's linguistic processing capabilities, the project identifies and extracts key terms and phrases from the content. This feature enhances information retrieval and facilitates quick understanding of the document's main topics.
## User-Friendly Interface
o	The project uses Streamlit library to provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. Users can input text, upload files, or specify web URLs for summarization and keyword extraction.
