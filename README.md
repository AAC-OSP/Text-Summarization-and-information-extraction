# Introduction
-	In the era of information overload, the "Text Summarization and Information Extraction Tool" is an innovative project designed to empower users with efficient and intelligent methods for processing textual content. This tool combines the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and web scraping to facilitate text summarization and information retrieval from both user-provided text and online sources, such as Wikipedia articles.

# Requirements
For running the code, make sure that the following are installed on your local device.

# DB Schema Design
The app has SQLite named **database.sqlite3** database with 7 tables in the database folder. These tables store user and manager credentials, categories and products managers add, a table to keep track of user purchases, sales for managers and cart to keep track of user items.

|Table Name|Column Details|
|----------|--------------|
|managers|manager_id(integer, primary key), username(string), password(string)|
|users|user_id(integer, primary key), username(string), password(string), email(string)|
|categories|category_id(string, primary key), name(string), search(string)|
|products|product_id(string, primary key), category_id(string), name(string), search(string), price(numeric), stock(numeric), unit(string), fractal_allowed(string)|
|cart|cart_id(string, primary key), user_id(string), product_id(string_, quantity(numeric), unit(string), price(numeric)|
|sales|product_id(string, primary key), category_id(string), quantity(numeric), sale(numeric)|
|purchases|Transaction_id(string, primary key), user_id(string), price(numeric), date(string)|
