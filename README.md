# Abstract
## Text Summarization
Utilizing spaCy's advanced NLP capabilities, the system employs extractive summarization techniques to condense lengthy textual content while preserving the essence and context.

## File Summarization
•	Extending beyond individual text documents, the project supports the summarization of entire files, be they in text or PDF formats. This feature aids in efficient management and comprehension of large datasets.

## Web Scraping
•	The system incorporates web scraping functionalities to fetch and process information from online sources. This ensures that the summarization process is not confined to pre-existing datasets but can dynamically adapt to the evolving landscape of the internet.

## Keyword Extraction
•	Employing spaCy's linguistic processing capabilities, the project identifies and extracts key terms and phrases from the content. This feature enhances information retrieval and facilitates quick understanding of the document's main topics.

## User-Friendly Interface
•	The project uses Streamlit library to provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. Users can input text, upload files, or specify web URLs for summarization and keyword extraction.

# Introduction
•	In the era of information overload, the "Text Summarization and Information Extraction Tool" is an innovative project designed to empower users with efficient and intelligent methods for processing textual content. This tool combines the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and web scraping to facilitate text summarization and information retrieval from both user-provided text and online sources, such as Wikipedia articles.

# Literature Review
## Text Summarization Techniques
•	Over the years, various approaches have been explored in the realm of text summarization. Early methods were rule-based, relying on predefined linguistic patterns. However, the shift towards machine learning and NLP algorithms, such as those offered by spaCy, has significantly enhanced the accuracy and contextual understanding of summarization.

## File Summarization Strategies
•	While text summarization primarily focuses on individual documents, file summarization extends this capability to broader datasets. The challenge lies in maintaining coherence and relevance across multiple documents. Research in this area emphasizes clustering, topic modelling, and advanced linguistic analysis — all areas where spaCy's capabilities come to the forefront.

## Web Scraping for Dynamic Content
•	As the digital landscape evolves, web scraping has become integral to information extraction. The literature acknowledges the need for tools that can dynamically adapt to changing online content. The fusion of spaCy's linguistic analysis with web scraping techniques opens new possibilities for real-time summarization.

## Keyword Extraction for Enhanced Understanding
•	Keyword extraction is pivotal for distilling the core themes of a document. SpaCy's capabilities in linguistic analysis make it a natural choice for extracting meaningful keywords that encapsulate the essence of the text.
